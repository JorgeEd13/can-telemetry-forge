## Current focus

**F3 is done — the labeled anomaly/fault layer is complete.** The anomaly layer is
now a **declarative injector registry** (ADR-016, the same philosophy as the signal
registry ADR-012): three defect families — obvious outliers, joint/contextual
outliers, and segment-based sensor faults (stuck/drift/dropout) — each a
self-describing injector. `forge generate` emits a single open-vocabulary
`anomaly_type` categorical + `anomaly_signal`, with `is_outlier` kept as a
value-distortion rollup; every defect is recoverable from labels, era-`NULL` cells
are never touched, and at most one defect lands per cell. Next is **F4 —
distribution validation** (a `validate` command comparing generated distributions to
a license-checked public dataset, fetched at run time, never committed), then **F5**
(Tier-2 diversity + Tier-3 CAN-frame faults).

## Done

- **F0 — Foundations & runnable skeleton** (src-layout package, `forge` CLI, CI on
  Linux+Windows × Py 3.11/3.12, offline tests).
- **F1 — Signal model (J1939-grounded core):** `signals/` package — declarative
  `SignalSpec` registry (ADR-012), capability-era gating (`eras.py`, NULL-not-zero,
  ADR-008), deterministic per-signal generators (`generators.py`), PGNs recorded
  but inert (ADR-013). `docs/DATA_DICTIONARY.md` committed.
- **F2 — Fleet simulator + writers (Tier 1 MVP):**
  - `config.py` — declarative config + **public-grounded fleet/region catalog** +
    seed plumbing. JSON config merging onto a runnable `default_config()` (ADR-015).
    Regions pinned to cited public **Köppen climate types + IRI road-roughness
    bands** (ADR-014; `source` travels in the `regions` table).
  - `sim/fleet.py` — operator→contracts→units: 5-class vehicle mix, triangular age
    curve with a legacy tail, per-contract sizes drawn around an expected value;
    build year → era; runtime/age at window start.
  - `sim/drivers.py` — per-unit `DriverSeries` (duty rhythm, region ambient
    sinusoid, altitude/terrain, monotonic accumulated wear) feeding F1.
  - `labels/failure.py` — **multi-mode** `failure_within_h` + `failure_mode`
    (overheat / oil_starve / bearing), hazard from era-gated signals + wear,
    sampled & derived in **one place** (ADR-009).
  - `anomalies/outliers.py` — labeled obvious out-of-range outliers, recoverable
    from an `is_outlier` mask (ADR-006; the F3 slice that ships in the MVP).
  - `sim/simulate.py` — composes it all over the fleet × window into a tidy long
    `readings` table + dimension tables. One spawned `SeedSequence` per unit per
    stage → independent yet reproducible streams (ADR-005).
  - `io/writers.py` — Parquet / CSV / DuckDB + `manifest.json` (provenance) +
    generated `dataset_dictionary.md`.
  - `cli.py` — `forge generate --config --seed --out --format --days --resolution`
    over the library; `forge validate` still a stub (F4).
  - `configs/fleet.json` — shipped sample config.
  - **31 new offline tests (59 total green.)** Verified end-to-end: default fleet →
    106 units, 915,840 readings, all three failure modes present (overheat 34k /
    oil_starve 16k / bearing 12k), EGT NULL for the pre-Modern 57%, era mix
    45 Modern / 44 Mid / 17 Legacy.
- **F3 — Labeled anomaly & fault injection (declarative registry):**
  - `anomalies/spec.py` — the `AnomalyInjector` type + the closed-schema /
    open-vocabulary `anomaly_type` set + the `VALUE_DISTORTION_TYPES` rollup set.
  - `anomalies/injectors.py` — the registry: `obvious_outlier` (out-of-range spike),
    `joint_outlier` (in-range but contextually impossible pairs), and segment-based
    `sensor_stuck` / `sensor_drift` / `sensor_dropout`.
  - `anomalies/inject.py` — `apply_anomalies` orchestrator: per-signal eligibility
    (non-NULL, unclaimed) → ≤1 defect/cell; per-row label resolution by injector
    priority; one seeded stream per injector.
  - `config.py` — `anomaly_rates` per-type map (merges onto `DEFAULT_ANOMALY_RATES`);
    `obvious_outlier_rate` retained as a back-compat alias; validated.
  - `sim/simulate.py` — emits `anomaly_type` + `anomaly_signal` + the `is_outlier`
    rollup; one child rng per injector per unit.
  - `io/writers.py` — per-type counts in `manifest.json`; generated dictionary
    documents the new columns. ADR-016 recorded; DATA_DESIGN §8 / DATA_DICTIONARY
    updated.
  - **14 new offline tests (73 total green.)** Verified e2e (20-day/5-min, seed 5):
    all five families present; `n_outlier_rows` == obvious+joint+stuck+drift
    (dropout excluded, as documented).

## Next step (concrete)

**F4 — Distribution validation.** A `validation/` script + a real `forge validate`
implementation (currently a stub) that compares the generated distributions against
a **license-checked** public CAN/OBD/J1939 dataset (histograms, summary stats) and
emits a self-contained report. Public data is fetched at run time, **never
committed**, and **CI must not require it** (validation is opt-in). DoD: report
reproducible from a documented command; license note in README + an ADR.

## Notes

- No GPU, no paid services, no training tokens — local NumPy/pandas; CI is free.
- Clean-room provenance is load-bearing: SAE J1939 + documented physics + cited
  public climate/road sources; fictional operator; never a real-log seed.
- Determinism is a hard invariant: one master `SeedSequence` spawned into
  per-stage child streams; same config + seed → byte-identical tables.
- Config is JSON (stdlib, no YAML dep). The bundled default is a complete fleet, so
  `--config` is optional.
